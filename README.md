# hexdump
Implementation of the Unix hexdump utility in x86 Assembly. 

- To assemble: `C:\> makeasm hexdump`
- To run: `C:\> hexdump <file>`

Hexdump shows every byte in a given file by giving both its value (in hex) and its printed character
representation (when it has one). hexdump.asm, coded in x86 assembly, is an implementation of hexdump written as a project for Hamilton College's Computer Science 240: Computer Organization course.
